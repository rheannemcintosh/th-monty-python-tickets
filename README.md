# The Monty Python Tickets System :snake:

## Project Overview
The Monty Python Tickets System is a basic Python command line application which I created at the start of my Python journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-project). This was developed as part of my **100 Days of Treehouse Challenge**.

## Initial Work
The initial work was completed by following along with the ... tutorial, with some small edits along the way. The code was then formatted to comply with PEP8 Standards.
